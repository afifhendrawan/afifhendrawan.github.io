I have tried to implement Miyazaki's specular-free method on MATLAB. I'm new at image processing, so if you find anything wrong about this script, please leave a comment. This script based on ***Daisuke Miyazaki et al.*** publication "Polarization-based Inverse Rendering from a Single View" and awesome explanation at [this page](http://www.cg.info.hiroshima-cu.ac.jp/~miyazaki/knowledge/teche40.html)
